# colocalizationIHC
An FIJI (ImageJ) macro to automate multi-channel colocalization analyses. Requries pre-drawing ROIs in FIJI of two types: polygonal (for regions) and multi-point (if counting cells/puncta). Performs background subtraction, intensity for each active channel and pairwise Pearson's correlation (un-thresholded). If multi-point ROIs are present to designate cells/puncta, will divide counts into each region. Outputs csv file.
